<b>The objective of the project is to build an autonomous mail delivery system. It is based around Rover Tank Body and Basys3 Board. The rover follows a metallic tape path and delivers a single mail to three different recipients. The recipients are differentiated by the frequency of infrared light underneath the 6x3x6 inch box. Thus, the system is made up of three different sub-systems, motor control, IR detection, and mail delivery.
