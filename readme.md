# Project Hoolaki: Autonomous Mail Delivery Robot


## Objective
Build an autonomous mail delivery system. It is based around a Rover Tank Body and BASYS3 Board. The rover follows a metallic tape path and delivers a single mail to three different recipients, differentiated by *Infrared Frequency*. The recipients are differentiated by the frequency of infrared light underneath the 6x3x6 inch box. Thus, the system is made up of three different sub-systems, motor control, IR detection, and mail delivery.
